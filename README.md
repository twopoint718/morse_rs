# morse_rs
The handy Morse code command line tool you didn't know you needed.

## Building

Is a standard Rust project that only depends on the [wav](https://crates.io/crates/wav) crate.

```
$ cargo build
```

## Usage

When you run

```
$ cargo run
```

it will create a file `output.wav` with a hardcoded message.
Not very fancy right now, I know.
